Collaboration is probably the textbook term for working in group settings. At its core, it means working together in a group to achieve a common goal. 
Ideally, collaboration is supposed to "include everyone" and "be greater than the sum of its parts".
What's too often abstracted away, though, is how this is to be done. 

Consider a group project at school, perhaps the most traditional example of collaboration. 
As much as we wouldn't like to admit it, power imbalance in the group makes it difficult, or 
even impossible, for contribution to be equitable. A single person or smaller group of people within the group often ends up doing most of the work. 
This isn't even necessarily because that single person or subgroup wants to do most of the work. 
Rather, their greater ideas or work ethic ends up overpowering that of the rest of the group. 
Consequently, the value of the group becomes not "greater than the sum of its parts" or even "equal to the sum of its parts", but at most its greatest part.
Furthermore, as only a select few in the group actually get to contribute ideas, most of the group doesn't actually get to learn.

A quick bandaid to fix this is "divide and conquer", where each member of the group is delegated a smaller responsibility, such that
the common goal can be achieved if all responsibilities are adequately met. 
However, this defeats the idea of collaboration altogether. Even though everyone is contributing to the common goal, there is no longer any "working together."
There is no longer any opportunity for the group's nuanced ideas to interact and become something greater. 
Indeed, with "divide and conquer", the value of the group is "equal to the sum of its parts", but still not "greater".

To fix this, I've come up with the idea of **collaborative self-discovery**. Here's a synopsis of what I propose:

>Lead a community to take on a challenging problem. 
For each step of the problem, have an individual in the community suggest what to do next, adding atop the previous ideas. 
The ultimate solution therefore becomes a synthesis of diverse ideas, one perhaps no one could come up with alone. 
Effectively, we catalyze self-discovery, but the catalyst is collaboration.

This addresses all the shortcomings of the previous two approaches: 
* Everyone is given an equitable voice, so no one overpowers. 
* The group's nuanced ideas interact: ideas build on top of each other. 
* The value of the group is "greater than the sum of its parts" as the ultimate solution is one perhaps no one could come up with alone.
